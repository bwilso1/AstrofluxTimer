# AstrofluxTimer
Essentially an 'egg timer' that I wrote to help me keep track of base capture times for a game I used to play.  I was going to add support for custom timers, but I stopped playing the game a while ago.

You set timers by clicking on the Galaxy > System > Planet and then type how much time to put in.  For times greater than 5 mins, an additional 'warning' timer is produced.

use GUI.java as the running class

the game can be found at http://www.astroflux.net/
